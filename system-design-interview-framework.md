# System Design Interview Framework: ‘Build X’

<a name="real-world-framing"></a>
## 0. Real-World Framing (1 min)

- **Purpose**: Acknowledge the gap between interview exercises and real-world system design.

- **Key Point**: In practice, you design systems with the team you have. Familiarity, existing tooling, and organizational risk tolerance matter more than textbook architectures.

 - **Suggested Opening Statement**
  > “This interview is designed to evaluate my fluency in system design, familiarity with common technologies, and ability to weigh trade-offs. But in the real world, architecture choices are grounded in what your team knows and has the capacity to maintain. So while I’ll explore leading practices and trade-offs, I’ll stay grounded in pragmatic choices a team could realistically execute.”

## 1. Scope & Assumptions (5 min)

 - 1.1 **Business Motivation**  
   - What problem are we solving, and why now?  
   - Strategic objectives and key stakeholders.  
   - Organizational success criteria (e.g. revenue uplift, cost reduction, user growth).

 - 1.2 **Users & Use Cases**  
   - Primary personas and their goals.  
   - Core journeys (MVP vs. full feature set).  
   - Platform constraints (web, iOS, Android, public API).

 - 1.3 **Budget & Monetization**  
   - Phase‑appropriate budget limits (MVP vs. scale).  
   - Revenue models: ads, subscriptions, transactions.  
   - Unit‑economics impact of design choices (cost per user/transaction).

 - 1.4 **Design & Optimization Goals**  
   - Performance targets (P50/P95 latency, throughput).  
   - Reliability commitments (SLAs, [error budgets](https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/kpis/error-budget)).  
   - Scalability thresholds (peak users/day, requests/sec).

 - 1.5 **Success & Failure Metrics**  
   - Technical KPIs: latency percentiles, availability, error rate.  
   - Business KPIs: conversion, engagement, retention.  
   - Operational health: [MTTR](<https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/kpis/common-metrics#:~:text=MTTR%20(mean%20time%20to%20recovery%20or%20mean%20time%20to%20restore,it%20becomes%20fully%20operational%20again.>), incident count.

## 2. High‑Level Architecture (3 min)

  > Before diving into specific components, it’s helpful to align on the high-level architecture and how core traffic flows through the system.

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/four tier architecture.png" height="250" />
  </div><br>

  - 2.1 **Tiered Architecture (Four‑Tier Model)**  
  _Client → Edge → Business → Data_

    - **Client Tier**  
      - Mobile/Web clients handle UI rendering, local caching, and request shaping.  

    - **Edge Tier**  
      - Ingress: [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network), [TLS termination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS_termination_proxy), [L7 routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model#Layer_architecture), basic caching.
      - API Gateway (optional): Authentication, rate‑limits, quotas, request shaping.

    - **Business Tier**  
      - BFFs (Backends for Frontends): Client‑specific adapters, payload aggregation.
      - Core Services: Domain logic, orchestration, long‑running jobs.
      - Service Mesh: [mTLS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-mutual-tls/), retries, circuit‑breaking, observability.

    - **Data Tier**  
      - Databases, object storage, queues, and external APIs.

  - 2.2 Request Flow

    1. **Client** issues a request →  
    2. **Ingress** handles TLS, routing & CDN cache →  
    3. *(Public API only)* **API Gateway** enforces auth & quotas →  
    4. **BFF** transforms and aggregates →  
    5. **Core Services** run business logic (sync or via events) →  
    6. **Data Tier** persists/retrieves state →  
    7. Response returns via the same path.

<a name="frontend"></a>
## 3. Frontend (3 min)

  - 3.1 **Platforms**
    - Web: [React](https://react.dev/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Angular](https://angular.dev/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
    - Native: [Swift](https://www.swift.org/) (iOS), [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)/Java (Android).
    - Cross‑platform: React Native, [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), [.NET MAUI](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/).

  - 3.2 **Data Fetching**
    - [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) vs. [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) based on payload flexibility.
    - Use REST for external/public APIs and [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) for internal service-to-service calls that benefit from type safety and lower overhead.
    - Polling for semi‑real‑time updates.
    - WebSockets or [SSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) for persistent two‑way communication.

  - 3.3 **API Design Principles**
    - Use REST for straightforward resource-based APIs and widespread tooling compatibility.
    - Use GraphQL for complex data-fetching needs where clients benefit from flexible payload shaping and bundling.
    - Follow consistent versioning strategy (e.g., URI versioning or headers).
    - Define pagination, filtering, and sorting behaviors explicitly.
    - Treat APIs as products: document clearly, support deprecation, and consider developer experience (DX) across web, mobile, and partner clients.

  - 3.4 **Client‑Side Caching & Offline Support**
    - In‑memory storage and local persistence ([IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) for web; [AsyncStorage](https://reactnative.dev/docs/asyncstorage) or [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) for mobile/main apps).
    - Offline queue for writes and background sync.
    - Cache invalidation strategies ([stale‑while‑revalidate](https://web.dev/articles/stale-while-revalidate), TTL).

  - 3.5 **Session Management & Notifications**
    - Token storage & refresh patterns (cookies, localStorage).
    - Secure handling of refresh tokens (HttpOnly cookies, secure storage).
    - Push notifications setup ([APNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Push_Notification_service), [FCM](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging)) and in‑app notification handlers.

  - 3.6 **Ownership**
    - Typically owned by frontend or full‑stack engineering squads.
    - Collaborates closely with UX, product, and backend/BFF teams.

<a name="edge-gateway-layer"></a>
## 4. Edge / Gateway Layer (3 min)

  - 4.1 **Purpose and Role**: This layer sits between your clients and your backend systems, providing security, traffic management, and protocol translation so frontend and backend teams can iterate independently.

  - 4.2 **Edge Components**
    - **Ingress Proxy**
      - CDN & Global Load Balancer (e.g. [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/), [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)).
      - TLS termination, health checks, basic L7 routing.
    - **API Gateway** *(optional for public APIs)*
      - Authentication & authorization ([JWT/OAuth introspection](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-jwt-introspection-response-12.html), API keys).
      - Rate limiting, IP allow/deny lists, request validation (schema, size).
      - Request shaping (body size quotas, header transformations) .
    - **Cross‑Cutting Edge Services**
      - Feature‑flag evaluation ([LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/), [Flagsmith](https://www.flagsmith.com/)).
      - Token bootstrapping for service‑mesh sidecars.
      - Edge compute functions ([Lambda@Edge](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/), [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)).

  - 4.3 **Core Responsibilities**
    - **Security and Compliance**
      - Enforce [authN/authZ](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/authn-vs-authz/) before any backend logic runs.
      - Protect against [DDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack), [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), and [IP‑based threats](https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/ip-based-attack/44647) like IP spoofing.
    - **Traffic Management**
      - Rate limits, quotas, circuit‑breaking at the edge.  
      - Canary or blue/green routing for safe deployments.<br>
      _See Section 8.2 ("Deployment Strategies") for additional detail._
    - **Request Routing & Protocol Translation**
      - Route to the correct backend service or BFF.
      - Translate protocols (HTTP⇄gRPC, WebSocket upgrades).
    - **Payload Mapping & Shaping**
      - Fan‑out or aggregate requests.
      - Rename fields, slim payloads, inject metadata.
    - **Performance Optimization** 
      - Cache static and dynamic content at CDN edges.
      - Offload simple compute (geolocation, A/B logic) to edge workers.

  - 4.4 **Ownership**: Platform team or shared between frontend/backend leads.

<a name="backend-core-services"></a>
## 5. Backend Core Services (10 min)

  - 5.1 **Frontend‑Integration Layer (BFF)**  
    - Acts as the “true backend edge” for each client type (web, mobile, partner).  
    - Tailors payloads, aggregates across domain services, and translates protocols (e.g. [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) → REST).  
    - Enforces any client‑specific caching, request shaping, or retry logic before hitting core services.

  - 5.2 **Business Domain Services**  
    - Examples: Orders, Messages, Trips, Profiles.  
    - Each service owns a cohesive set of entities and logic, exposing internal APIs for orchestration.

  - 5.3 **Service Mesh (Sidecar‑Based Networking)**  
    - Provides [mTLS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-mutual-tls/), circuit‑breaking, retries, and distributed tracing for all inter‑service calls.  
    - Enforces network‑level policies ([ACLs](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/network-access-control-list), rate‑limits) consistently, independent of service code.  
    - Offloads common concerns so each service—plus the BFF layer—can remain lean.

  - 5.4 **Cross‑Cutting Platform Services**  
    - Shared infrastructure for auth, notifications, billing, metrics, experiments.  
    - Some responsibilities (e.g. rate‑limiting, token validation) may run at the edge or in BFF; heavier or async logic lives here.

  - 5.5 **Architecture Styles**  
    - Monolith, modular monolith, or microservices: each can host BFFs and sidecars.  
    - With microservices, you typically deploy BFFs and sidecars in the same cluster, but route traffic via the ingress/API gateway.<br>
    _See generally [Monolith to Microservices](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html)._

  - 5.6 **Communication Patterns**  
    - Synchronous RPC (REST, [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)) for BFF→Domain and Domain→Domain calls, all secured by the mesh.  
    - Async Messaging (Pub/Sub, Queues) for background workflows, decoupled from client‑facing BFFs.

  - 5.7 **Stateless vs Stateful Services**  
    - BFFs and most domain services should be stateless to scale easily.  
    - Stateful systems (sessions, game state) require sticky sessions or external state stores.

  - 5.8 **Infrastructure Patterns**  
    - Sidecar proxies ([Envoy](https://blog.christianposta.com/microservices/00-microservices-patterns-with-envoy-proxy-series/)/[Istio](https://istio.io/)) alongside every service pod, including BFF deployments.  
    - Mesh control plane on its own tier, speaking to sidecars across all services.
    
  - 5.9 **Trade‑Offs**  
    - BFF adds per‑client code but simplifies core services.  
    - Service Mesh gives consistency and security but adds operational complexity.

  - 5.10 **Communication Style: Request vs. Event Driven**
    - Request‑Driven (e.g., REST, [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)): Synchronous RPC-style communication between services. Well-suited for real-time flows where immediate feedback is needed, such as user actions or transactional updates.
    - Event‑Driven (e.g., queues, Pub/Sub, event streams): Asynchronous messaging used for background jobs, system decoupling, and resilience under load. Often backed by [Apache Kafka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Kafka), [Apache Pulsar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Pulsar), or cloud-native equivalents.
    - Common Patterns:
        - Core services often use request-based RPC, while async workflows (e.g., billing, notifications, ML pipelines) are handled via events.
        - Events are also used to power downstream consumers: audit logs, analytics, or materialized views.
    - Most systems combine both: sync for control paths, async for data and side effects.

  - 5.11 **Ownership**
    - BFFs often owned by the feature or frontend‑platform team.  
    - Core services by domain teams.  
    - Mesh control plane by the platform/SRE team.

<a name="data-storage-retrieval"></a>
## 6. Data Storage & Retrieval (5 min)

  - 6.1 Data Store Categories & Limitations  
    - **Relational (SQL)**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)  
        - Use: [ACID transactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID), complex joins, ad‑hoc queries.
        - Limitations: Challenging to scale horizontally (sharding/cluster required); heavy schema migrations.
    - **Key–Value Stores**: [Redis](https://redis.io/), [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)  
        - Use: Ultra‑low‑latency get/put for sessions, caches, user state.
        - Limitations: No rich query or relationship support; minimal indexing.
    - **Document Stores**: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com/)  
        - Use: JSON‑style documents, flexible/evolving schemas.
        - Limitations: Limited joins/transactions; risk of denormalization and data duplication.
    - **Column‑Family Stores**: [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/), [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/)  
        - Use: High write throughput, wide‑column models, time‑series data.
        - Limitations: Eventual consistency by default; operational complexity (compaction, repair).
    - **Graph Databases**: [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/), [Amazon Neptune](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/)  
        - Use: Deep relationship traversals (social graphs, recommendations).
        - Limitations: Poor horizontal write scalability; specialized query language.
    - **Time‑Series DBs**: [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/), [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/)  
        - Use: Efficient ingestion & querying of timestamped metrics/events.
        - Limitations: Needs retention/downsampling; storage bloat risk.
    - **Search & Analytics Engines**: [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/), [Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/), [Typesense](https://typesense.org/)
        - Use: Full‑text search, [faceted filtering](https://www.prefixbox.com/blog/faceted-filtering/), aggregations.
        - Limitations: Eventual consistency; heavy index rebuilds; high resource use.

  - 6.2 When to Choose Which Store  
    - **SQL**: Transactions + joins + strong consistency.
    - **Key–Value**: Simple lookups + caching + session data.
    - **Document**: Semi‑structured or rapidly evolving schemas.
    - **Graph**: Complex many‑to‑many relationships, deep traversals.
    - **Time‑Series**: High‑frequency timestamped writes, windowed queries.
    - **Search**: Text search, analytics, log exploration.<br>
    _**Caution**: Don’t pick NoSQL merely to avoid schema design: poor data models create hidden debt._

  - 6.3 [CAP Theorem](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/cap-theorem/) & ACID Trade‑Offs  
    - **CAP Theorem** (under network partition)
      - CP: Consistency + Partition tolerance (sacrifice availability).
      - AP: Availability + Partition tolerance (sacrifice consistency).
      - CA: Consistency + Availability (no partition tolerance).<br>
      _See also [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36404765/why-isnt-rdbms-partition-tolerant-in-cap-theorem-and-why-is-it-available/64427972#64427972) for a diagrammatic discussion of the three CAP theorem options._
    - **ACID Transactions**
      - Atomicity: All or nothing; if any part of the transaction fails, roll back.
      - Consistency: Valid state transitions; all data integrity constraints and business rules are maintained throughout the transaction.
      - Isolation: No interference among concurrent transactions. Changes made by one transaction are not visible to other transactions until the first transaction is committed.
      - Durability: Persistence through failures; changes are permanently stored in the database, even if the system fails or crashes. 

  - 6.4 Blob Storage for Media  
      - [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [GCS](https://cloud.google.com/storage), [Azure Blob](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs): object stores for large binaries or static assets (fronted by CDN).

  - 6.5 Search Layer  
      - [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/), [Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/), [Typesense](https://typesense.org/): specialized engines for text search and analytics; evaluate SaaS vs. self‑hosted.  

  - 6.6 Ownership  
      - Shared among application teams (schema design, queries), data engineering (ETL/pipelines), and platform/infrastructure teams (operations, scaling).

## 7. Scalability, Reliability & Performance (5 min)

  > When designing for scale, it's useful to distinguish between **vertical scaling** (making a single instance more powerful) and **horizontal scaling** (adding more instances). Most modern systems aim to scale horizontally for long-term flexibility, but both strategies have a role.

  - 7.1 **Vertical Scaling (Scale-Up)**
    - Add more CPU, RAM, or IOPS to a single node.
    - Quickest path to performance gains in early-stage systems.
    - Simple to implement, but limited by hardware ceilings and diminishing returns.

  - 7.2 **Horizontal Scaling (Scale-Out)**
    - Add more nodes behind a load balancer (e.g., web servers, DB replicas).
    - Often requires stateless services, sharded databases, or eventual consistency models.
    - Enables fault tolerance and high availability but increases architectural complexity.

  - 7.3 **Reliability Techniques**
    - Autoscaling triggers & constraints (CPU, memory, custom metrics like queue length).
    - Scale‑in safeguards (to avoid thrashing during transient load spikes).
    - Health checks (readiness and liveness probes) are critical for detecting broken or overloaded instances and safely removing them from load balancers.
    - Auto-Healing mechanisms (e.g., in [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) or with auto-scaling groups) restart unhealthy services automatically without human intervention.
    - Ensure retries are safe and idempotent for critical operations (e.g., payments, orders); use [idempotency keys](https://docs.stripe.com/api/idempotent_requests) or deduplication when needed.
    - Chaos engineering (e.g., [Chaos Monkey](https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/)‑style fault injection) to proactively validate fail‑over paths.<br>
    _See [Principles of Chaos Engineering](https://principlesofchaos.org/) for an overview._
    - Multi-Region Deployment protects against entire region outages and reduces latency for global users, but adds complexity in data replication, failover routing, and consistency guarantees.
    - Defining SLIs/SLOs (latency P95, error budgets) as the foundation for any auto‑scale or circuit‑breaker policies.

  - 7.4 **Performance Optimizations**
    - Caching: CDN, [Redis](https://redis.io/), application-layer caching.
    - [Backpressure and Resiliency](https://medium.com/@leela.kumili/when-systems-hit-a-traffic-jam-how-to-handle-backpressure-effectively-d3d71854faf3): queuing, retry (with backoff), and circuit breakers
    - Query Tuning, Connection Pooling, Compression.
    - Load/stress testing (e.g. [Gatling](https://gatling.io/), [JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/)) to validate horizontal‑scale behavior before prod rollouts.

  - 7.5. Ownership: Typically shared between SRE, infrastructure teams, and performance-focused engineers within product teams.

<a name="deployment-observability-security-ownership"></a>
## 8. Deployment, Observability, Security & Ownership (as time allows)
 
 - 8.1 **CI/CD & Infrastructure as Code**  
   - Automate build, test, and deployment (e.g., [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)).  
   - Manage infra as code (e.g., [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/)) and configuration as code ([Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Helm](https://helm.sh/), [Packer](https://www.packer.io/)).  
 
 - 8.2 **Deployment Strategies**  
   - Blue/Green: instant rollback, doubled infra cost.  
   - Canary: phased rollout, relies on robust metrics and traffic control.<br>
   _Safe deployments rely on robust pre-prod validation and test environments — see Section 9.9 ("Testing and Pre-Prod Environments") for guidance on staging, load testing, and end-to-end validation._
 
 - 8.3 **Observability & Alerting**  
   - Metrics, logs, and traces (e.g., [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)).  
   - Dashboards, [SLIs/SLOs](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/sre-fundamentals-sli-vs-slo-vs-sla), and error budgets.  
   - Alerting and on-call workflows (e.g., [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/), [Opsgenie](https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie)).  
 
 - 8.4 **Security Controls**  
   - Authentication & authorization ([OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/), [RBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)).  
   - Secrets management (e.g., [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/)).  
   - Network security (e.g., firewalls, mTLS).  
   - Encryption in transit ([TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)) and at rest ([AES-256](https://www.kiteworks.com/risk-compliance-glossary/aes-256-encryption/)).  
   - Supply chain integrity (image signing [Notary v2](https://github.com/notaryproject/notary), vulnerability scanning [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)).  
 
 - 8.5 **Ownership**  
   - CI/CD & IaC: DevOps/Platform teams.  
   - Observability: SRE/Infrastructure teams.  
   - Security: Security team with feature-team integration.

## 9. Extensions, Trade-Offs, Bottlenecks & Evolution (as time allows)

  - 9.1 **Extensions & Integrations**  
    - **AI/ML Services**
        - Traditional models: recommendations, fraud detection, anomaly detection.
        - Generative AI: LLM-based summarization, chatbots, content generation.
    - **Vector & Semantic Search**
        - Embedding pipelines, vector databases ([Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/), [Milvus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milvus_(software))) for similarity search. 
    - **External APIs & SaaS Integrations**
        - Payment gateways, geolocation, identity providers, mapping, social logins.
    - **Event-Driven Pipelines**
        - Streaming analytics, real-time notifications, data pipelines ([Apache Kafka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Kafka), [Apache Pulsar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Pulsar)).
        - **Geographic Scaling**: multi-region failover, data residency, latency optimization. 
        - **Privacy & Compliance**: [PII separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data#Examples_of_personally_identifiable_information), encryption requirements, [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)/[HIPAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act) constraints.  

  - 9.2 **Common Bottlenecks & Mitigations**  
    _See Sections 7 (“Scalability, Reliability & Performance”) and 6.1 (“Data Store Categories & Limitations”) for patterns on write limits, cache pressure, queue backlogs, and latency mitigation._

  - 9.3 **Migration & Evolution Strategies**  
    - **Monolith to Microservices**: incremental extraction ([strangler‑fig pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html)).
    - **Modular Monolith**: adopt modules before splitting into services. 
    - **Schema Versioning**: backward/forward‑compatible migrations, dual writes.
    - **Feature Toggles**: safe rollout, canary releases, controlled deprecation.

  - 9.4 **Trade‑Offs & Failure Modes**  
    _Covered in Sections 6.3 (“CAP Theorem & ACID Trade‑Offs”), 7.4 (“Performance Optimizations”), and 8.4 (“Security Controls”)._

  - 9.5 **System Evolution Patterns**  
    - Feature toggles, schema versioning, modularization over time.

  - 9.6 **Design Trade-Off: Event-Driven or Not?**
    - **Interviewer Prompt**: “Should your design use event-driven architecture? If not, why not?”
      - This is a common axis for evaluating trade-off awareness. The right answer depends on the use case, desired coupling, and latency/throughput profile.
    - **Choose Request-Driven When**:
      - Simplicity, traceability, and strong consistency are critical.
      - You need immediate feedback (e.g., checkout flows, profile edits).
    - **Choose Event-Driven When**:
      - Loose coupling, resiliency, or horizontal scalability is needed.
      - You’re processing background work, derived data, or triggering workflows across domains.
    - **Communicate Your Rationale**: Explain where you’ve applied events and why. Highlight how you’ve handled failure (retries, backoff), observability, and delivery guarantees.

  - 9.7 **Tenancy Models**
    - **Single-Tenant Systems**: Each customer has a dedicated instance of the application and its data. Offers strong isolation and simplified debugging but incurs higher operational cost.
    - **Multi-Tenant Systems**: Multiple customers share infrastructure, with logical data separation via tenant IDs. More cost-effective and scalable, but introduces complexity around data access, security boundaries, and performance isolation.
    - **Hybrid Models**: Mix of pooled and siloed tenants — e.g., shared app layer but isolated databases or compute for high-paying customers.
    - **Design Considerations**:
      - How is tenant identity propagated and enforced throughout the system? Apply fine-grained authorization (e.g., RBAC, per-object ACLs) where required.
      - What per-tenant quotas, rate limits, or billing hooks exist?
      - Can operational visibility be segmented by tenant?
    - Your architecture should account for tenant isolation, scaling patterns, and operational concerns from the beginning, even if you start single-tenant.

  - 9.8 **Platformization & Developer Experience**
    - As systems and teams grow, consistency and velocity often become bottlenecks.
    - Platformization reduces friction by providing internal tools, templates, and abstractions that standardize core patterns (e.g., service creation, auth integration, metrics).
    - Developer experience (DX) initiatives improve build/run/debug loops and reduce context-switching overhead.
    - Common practices:
      - `create-service` CLIs or templates to scaffold new services with standard logging, tracing, metrics.
      - Shared SDKs for internal APIs (auth, config, billing).
      - Observability defaults: metrics, logs, alerts, and tracing pre-integrated into every service.
      - Self-service IaC: infra modules for queues, DBs, feature flags, storage.
    - A well-designed system should support internal reuse and allow teams to ship features safely and independently.

  - 9.9 **Testing & Pre-Prod Environments**
    - Mature systems rely on multiple environments to validate changes safely before production.
    - Common environments include:
      - **Staging**: Mirrors production as closely as possible for full end-to-end validation.
      - **Integration/Test**: Used to validate contract compatibility and shared services across teams.
      - **Load Testing**: Simulates peak traffic and failure conditions to verify scaling limits.
      - **Synthetic or Ephemeral Environments**: Temporary, isolated deployments (e.g., per-PR or feature branch) for faster iteration.
    - **Testing Strategies**:
      - Unit tests for individual components.
      - Integration tests for service-to-service behavior.
      - End-to-end tests for full system workflows (often via UI automation or API smoke tests).
      - Contract tests (e.g., [PACT](https://docs.pact.io/)) to detect breaking changes in upstream/downstream services.
    - Good pre-prod hygiene includes test data seeding, schema evolution checks, and observability parity with prod.
